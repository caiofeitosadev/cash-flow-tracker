# 💰 Cash Flow Tracker

A simple web application to manage and track your cash flow, allowing you to record money inputs and outputs. The project was developed as a practical exercise to learn front-end development concepts such as modularization, data persistence, and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

* Add new records for income (revenues) or expenses (outflows).
* View all records in an organized table.
* Calculate and display total income, total expenses, and the final balance.
* Delete records from the table and from local storage (`localStorage`).
* Visual feedback notifications for successful actions.
* Data persistence using the browser's `localStorage`, keeping records saved between sessions.

## 💻 Technologies

* **HTML5:** Application structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout.
* **TypeScript:** Application logic and typing.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control and collaboration.
